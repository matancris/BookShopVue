      Our staff are dedicated booksellers who love to read and recommend great
      books.<br /><br />
      Lindsay<br />
      Lindsay has been with the Mary Martin team since 2011 and is our fantastic
      book buyer. She is also a voracious reader and our most prolific reviewer.
      She reads widely across all genres but has a particular fondness for world
      history both in fiction and non-fiction. On her day off you’ll either find
      her sitting in a dimly lit cinema or curled up next to her cat Walter with
      a glass of whiskey and a good book.<br /><br />
      Suzy<br />
      Suzy has
      been at Mary Martin since 2008 and is currently studying Professional
      Editing and Writing at RMIT. An avid reader, she loves many genres but is
      particularly passionate about championing local authors. She has excellent
      taste in all things and is responsible for our famous greeting card
      selection and beautiful gifts and toys.<br /><br />
      Kat<br />
      Kat has
      been working at Mary Martin on and off since 2009. She loves to travel and
      when at home enjoys the thrill of discovering translated fiction from
      around the world. She also enjoys reading and recommending children’s
      books, and loves the challenge of matching young readers with the right
      book to spark a lifelong love of reading.
