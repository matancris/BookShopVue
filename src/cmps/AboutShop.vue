      Bookshop is an online bookstore with a mission to financially support
      local, independent bookstores. We believe that bookstores are essential to
      a healthy culture. They’re where authors can connect with readers, where
      we discover new writers, where children get hooked on the thrill of
      reading that can last a lifetime. They’re also anchors for our downtowns
      and communities.<br /><br />
      As more and more people buy their books online, we wanted to create an
      easy, convenient way for you to get your books and support bookstores at
      the same time.<br /><br />
      If you want to find a specific local bookstore to support, find them on
      our map and they’ll receive the full profit off your order. Otherwise,
      your order will contribute to an earnings pool that will be evenly
      distributed among independent bookstores (even those that don’t use
      Bookshop).<br /><br />
      By design, we give away over 75% of our profit margin to stores,
      publications, authors and others who make up the thriving, inspirational
      culture around books!<br /><br />
      We hope that Bookshop can help strengthen the fragile ecosystem and
      margins around bookselling and keep local bookstores an integral part of
      our culture and communities.<br /><br />
      Bookshop is a B-Corp - a corporation dedicated to the public good.
